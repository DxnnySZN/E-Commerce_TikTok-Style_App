# E-Commerce_TikTok-Style_App
 I am creating an E-Commerce TikTok-Style App where a random Walmart tech product will be showcased to the user. Providing the product image, title, and price, the user has the choice to add the product to their cart or decline it. Once they choose, another random Walmart tech product will be showcased. This can repeat for as long as the user wants until the user decides to check out their cart. From there, they can re-evaluate their decisions by swiping horizontally so they can be greeted with two buttons: one to remove the product and the other to confirm the purchase of the product. If they choose to purchase, the user will be brought to the Walmart product link. The user can also search for a desired product, check out the DiscoverPage to see more of the Walmart tech products, or modify their account settings.
