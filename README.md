# E-Commerce_TikTok-Style_App
 I am creating an E-Commerce TikTok-Style App where a random Walmart tech product will be showcased to the user. Providing the product image, title, and price, the user has the choice to add the product to their cart or decline it. Once they choose, another random Walmart tech product will be showcased. This can repeat for as long as the user wants until the user decides to check out their cart. From there, they can re-evaluate their decisions by swiping one direction to either remove the product or confirm the purchase for the product. If they choose to purchase, the user will be brought to the Walmart product link. Letâ€™s say the user has 10 items in their cart. If they wish to purchase all those items, the user will have to do the purchasing process every time for each item. Also, the user can search a desired product, check out the discovery page and see all of the Walmart tech products, or modify their account settings.
