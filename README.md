# E-Commerce_TikTok-Style_App
 I am creating an E-Commerce Tiktok-Style App where a random Walmart tech product will be showcased to the user. Providing the product title, description, image, and price, the user has the choice to add the product to their cart or decline it. Once they choose one of the two options, another random Walmart tech product will be showcased. This can repeat for as long as the user wants until the user decides to check out their cart. From there, they can re-evaluate their decisions by swiping one direction to delete it from their cart or swiping the other direction to confirm the purchase. If they choose to purchase, the app will not be responsible for physically accepting the purchase, so they will be brought to the Walmart product link. Letâ€™s say the user has 10 items in their cart. If they wish to purchase all those items, the user will have to do the purchasing process every time for each item. Also, the user can search a desired product, check out the discovery page and see the electronics deals, or modify their account settings.
